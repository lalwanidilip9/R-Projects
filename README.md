# R-Projects
This is my work on R from the statistics course I took during my Graduate studies at TAMU. The course involved writing and executing R programs under the Windows environment in the context of applied statistics problems. I have written R programs involving matrices, vectors and data frames for a school dataset. I have also worked on higher level graphics and adding objects to graphics.
